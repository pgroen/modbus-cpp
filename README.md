# modbus-cpp
The goal was to write a TCP / RTU modbus library written in c++ as a header-only, but reality quickly followed suit. 
To avoid large implementations in the header file and create a mess, I quickly decided to write it more conventional.

The Modbus protocol description kan be found in the 'documentation' folder. [documentation/protocol.md]
The actual implementation is described in [documentation/implementation.d]
